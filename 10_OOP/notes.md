# JavaScript and Classes

## OOP
- JavaScript is a bit different than in other languages. JavaScript is a prototype-based language, which means that objects can inherit properties and methods directly from other objects.
- Collection of properties and methods 
  
## why use OOP?
- It makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.

## parts of OOP
- Object literal = means creating an object using curly braces. 

- Constructor function = is a function that is used to create an object.
- Prototype = is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript, where function's prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property is not visible.
- Class = is a blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods.
- Inheritance = is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.

## 4 principles of OOP
- Encapsulation = is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.
- Abstraction = is the concept of object-oriented programming that "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information.
- Inheritance = is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
- Polymorphism = is the ability to present the same interface for different data types.
